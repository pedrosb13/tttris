**Q: What is this?**

A: A simple clone of the Tetris game for Android devices. Don't expect more.


**Q: A button is disabled. How can I enable it?**

A: Probably that button is intended for a feature which is not implemented yet. Don't worry about that and wait for a new release. Or help us and code it yourself!


**Q: I have installed the game and the elements of the screen are a mess!**

A: In theory, the game works and looks good in most devices. But it has been tested only in 3.7" QVGA devices with android 2.3. If screens don't show properly on your device, the best thing you can do is giving us feedback. You can see opened issues and open a new one [here](https://code.google.com/p/tttris/issues/list)


**Q: I like this project. How can I contribute?**

A: There are a lot of ways to contribute

  * If you preffer to translate the game to your own language, here is a [HowTo](https://code.google.com/p/tttris/wiki/HowToTranslate).
