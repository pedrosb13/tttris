A clone of the classic Tetris game for Android devices. You can try it out from [here](http://code.google.com/p/tttris/downloads/list)



### ![http://image.cp-g.de/pics/4f20243252021.png](http://image.cp-g.de/pics/4f20243252021.png) When? ###

Currently under development, it is more or less playable, although some features are missing, so don't expect to make a world record.

Please check the [wiki](https://code.google.com/p/tttris/wiki) to see what is implemented and what is not.

In theory, it should work in very Android device, but so far it has been tested only in 3.7" QVGA screen devices with Android 2.3 and 4.04

It is meant to be more a programming practice than a sales hit, so feel free to comment, share opinion, give ideas or advice, hating or contribute. Without pressure. Any help is always welcome.
