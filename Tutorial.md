# How does the game work #

Well, who doesn't know how to play Tetris?
The game goal is filling rows as pieces are falling, and never let theg get to the top of the board. Yon can move and rotate the pieces while they are falling. Full rows disappear, so, if you are skillful enough, its an endless game! But be careful, because the game becomes faster and faster every time.


# The screen #

From left-right, top-bottom, you have:
  * **The game board**: Where game goes on.
  * **Next piece indicator**: A preview of the next piece to be in game.
  * **The pause/resume button**: Nothing to say.
  * **Score**: Your score.
  * **Combo multiplier**: If you con't see that, it means its one. The score you make is multiplied by this value.
  * **Controls**: Buttons that allow you to control the currently falling piece. See below for more details.


# Scores #

Each full row scores 1000 points and increases your combo multiplier x2 (to a maximum of 16). Fulling two rows in a row ;-) scores 3000 (1000 + 2x1000), fulling three in a row scores 6000 (1000 + 2x1000 + 3x1000).
Fulling two (or more) pieces at once scores the same than doing it on a row.


# Controls #

You have five control buttons (left-right):
  * Rotate piece to the left.
  * Move piece to the left.
  * Move piece down, so you don't have to wait too long.
  * Move piece right.
  * Move piece to the right.


# Save/Load #

Game is automatically saved each time a piece is locked, so you don have to worry. From the main screen you can load previous game or start a new one discarding previous one.
